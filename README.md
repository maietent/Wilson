random name random kernel

the goal of this os is to fulfill an idea i had about kernel development  

why not do what game engine developers do, seperate both the engine and the game,  
then provide a sort of API for the game to interact with the engine?  

so, this time i wanted to make the kernel provide an interface for stuff like idt drivers,  
the framebuffer, etc, then make the actual "os" utilise that to make a userspace for example.
